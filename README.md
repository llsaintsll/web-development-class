# web-development-class

The main of this repo is to help me and others that are studying HTML, CSS and a lot of other things that an
Web development needs. With every class I have I want to be able to improve my skills and learn more.

I don't know with I will put coments on every commit i do, but I'll try to do my best, to explain what changes I made and
why.

Have a nice coding!
